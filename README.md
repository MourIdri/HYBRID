# azure-click-and-deploy
This repo is a 3-tier app script builder. 

It is building a Lamp app using 3-tier. 

the script : full_python_example.py is written in full python with Python SDK. It was very heavy and long...

the script : hybrid_deploy.py is written in python with some calls to Azure CLI (...) It its not the best Idea ever, but the CLI are so well written that I found it was a better approach than using the SDK
